This repository contains Arduino and Bonsai projects for running our electrophysiological experiments and behavioral tasks. It includes:
- Automatic maze control systems (linear tracks, forced alternation, cue-side choice, etc.)
- Diode control and high-resolution optogenetics protocols.
IMPORTANT: This is under collective developmentâ€”if you find something that needs changing or adding, please open an issue to help improve it.
