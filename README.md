# HippoPlayground
![GitHub Logo](/utilities/images/hippoPlayGround.png)

This repository contains all the Arduino and Bonsai Projects needed to run our electrophysiological experiments and behavior. This includes:
- Automatic maze control (linear, force alternation, cue-side choice, etc)
- Diode, and high-resolution optogenetics protocols.
IMPORTANT: everything is under collective development. If you find something that needs changing/adding, please open an issue and improve it.
